# Learning how to learn

This is the second project for the second sprint. 

## Project Description

In this project, we extended parts of project one by utilizing advanced HTML and CSS. Some, not all, of the new properties used were: animations, transform, and iframes.

## Plans for finalizing the project

I believe for this project to be complete I will need to create new pages for the links inside of each blocks. This way I can lead users to another landing page that is specific to the topic they want to expand in. Also, I might have some mistructured files that are not in BEM functionality, so I will need to fix that.
